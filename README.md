# Office16to19
Upgrade script for Office going to Office 2019 from any previous version (non-retail)
This script will check for the currently installed Office version and if it's not the minimum version number (16.0.10386.20017) for 2019 it will upgrade.

You will need a Office 2019 installer and configuration XML (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/office2019/deploy), script assumes these are located in C:\Temp
